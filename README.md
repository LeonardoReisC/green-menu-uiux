## Overview

This repository hosts the project files for the development of a restaurant delivery application called **Green Menu**. This application provides users with access to healthy meals and snacks made from organic ingredients.

It was developed as part of the UI/UX course at Federal University of Alfenas.

## 5W and 1H Analysis

In this phase, we conducted a thorough exploration using the 5W and 1H methodology, addressing key questions to outline the project's scope and objectives.
